            My path to becoming a mindfulness and meditation coach began in the rolling hills of Donegal, Ireland. 
            Growing up surrounded by nature's serene beauty, I developed an innate appreciation for moments of stillness 
            and presence, though I wouldn't recognize their true value until much later in life.

            Like many, my journey into meditation started during a challenging period. Working in a high-pressure 
            corporate environment in Dublin, I found myself increasingly disconnected from the present moment, 
            constantly anxious about the future and ruminating over the past. The stress manifested physically, 
            leading to sleepless nights and a persistent feeling of being overwhelmed.

            It was during this time that I discovered meditation through a local mindfulness-based stress reduction 
            (MBSR) programme. The practice resonated deeply with me, offering not just temporary relief but a 
            fundamental shift in how I related to my thoughts and experiences. What began as a weekly class soon 
            became a daily practice, transforming how I navigated both challenges and joys in my life.
          </p>

            Witnessing this profound change, I felt called to deepen my understanding. I completed my MBSR teacher 
            training certification in 2020, followed by specialised training in mindfulness for children in 2021. 
            Each step in my education reinforced what I had experienced personally: that mindfulness offers a 
            powerful, accessible path to greater wellbeing.

            Returning to my roots in Donegal, I began sharing these practices with others in my community. 
            What started as small group sessions soon grew as people experienced the benefits for themselves. 
            Through working with hundreds of students across various backgrounds—from corporate executives to 
            school children—I developed The OM Method, a personalised approach that makes mindfulness accessible 
            and relevant to modern life.

          <p>
            Today, I'm privileged to guide others on their mindfulness journeys, both in-person and online. 
            I believe that mindfulness isn't just a practice but a way of being—one that allows us to fully 
            engage with our lives whilst cultivating greater compassion for ourselves and others. It's this 
            philosophy that underpins everything I do as a meditation coach.
