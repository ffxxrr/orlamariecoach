# OrlaMarieCoach Website - Rendering Issue Fix

## Problem Summary
The website was experiencing the following issues:
1. A large meditation image was taking up the entire viewport
2. The navbar was not visible or improperly positioned
3. Tailwind CSS classes were not being applied correctly

## Root Causes
1. **Image Sizing Issue**: The meditation image in FreeMeditationSection used the `fill` property without proper constraints, causing it to expand beyond its container.
2. **Z-Index Conflicts**: Multiple components had improper z-index values, causing layering problems.
3. **CSS Processing**: PostCSS configuration was missing, preventing Tailwind from processing correctly.

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Fixed Image Handling in FreeMeditationSection
- Replaced the `fill` property with explicit `width` and `height` attributes
- Added additional CSS classes to ensure proper sizing and containment

```jsx
<Image
  src="/images/orla/optimized/about/7R500125.webp"
  alt="Orla Marie in a peaceful meditation setting"
  width={500}
  height={500}
  className="object-cover w-full h-full rounded-2xl"
  priority
/>
```

### 2. Corrected Z-Index Layering
- Changed BotanicalAccents z-index from `z-0` to `-z-10` to ensure it stays behind content
- Increased Navbar z-index from `z-50` to `z-[1000]` to ensure it always appears on top
- Added explicit `z-0` to Hero section to establish proper stacking context

### 3. Added PostCSS Configuration
- Created `postcss.config.js` in the project root to ensure Tailwind processes correctly:
```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}
```

### 4. Created Restart Script
- Added `restart-server.bat` to easily clear the Next.js cache and restart the server

## How to Apply the Fix
1. Make sure all file changes have been saved
2. Stop the current Next.js server (press Ctrl+C in the terminal)
3. Run the restart script: `.\restart-server.bat` 
4. Or manually:
   ```
   rmdir /s /q .next
   npm run dev
   ```

## Expected Results
- The navbar should be visible at the top of the page
- The meditation image should be properly contained within its section
- All Tailwind CSS classes should be applied correctly
- The page should have proper layout with all elements in their correct positions

## Additional Notes
- If issues persist, try clearing browser cache or opening in an incognito window
- This fix addresses CSS loading and z-index issues, which are common causes of layout problems in Next.js applications with Tailwind CSS
- The changes maintain the original design intent while fixing the technical issues

## Commit Reference
This fix should be committed with a descriptive message:
```
fix: resolve image rendering and navbar visibility issues

- Corrected z-index conflicts between components
- Added PostCSS configuration for proper Tailwind processing
