# Mockup Cleanup Plan - Page by Page

**Created:** 2025-05-23  
**Purpose:** Organize and clean up multiple mockup versions per 2025-05-22 Design Review Meeting feedback

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Overall Strategy

Based on the design review meeting, we have multiple versions of mockups that need organization. Each page will be cleaned up in separate chats to maintain focus and avoid confusion.

## ðŸ“‹ Chat Task Sets

### **CHAT 1: Homepage Cleanup** âœ… READY
