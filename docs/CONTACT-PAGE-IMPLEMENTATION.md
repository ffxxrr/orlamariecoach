- Implemented hover animations for better user interaction
- Created example questions in each category to help visitors identify their needs
- Added smooth scrolling links to the contact form

### 3. ContactForm
- Built a comprehensive form with all necessary fields:

## Technical Details

- Ensured all components are fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile

- Implemented React hooks for form state management and interactive elements
- Followed the project's CSS architecture with Tailwind CSS
- Maintained consistent brand styling across all elements
- Used UK English throughout all text (personalised vs personalized)

## Next Steps

1. **Book Session Page Implementation**: Create the booking page referenced in the Contact page
2. **Form Submission Handling**: Implement backend API for form submission
3. **Email Notification System**: Set up email notifications for contact form submissions
4. **Analytics Integration**: Add tracking for form submissions and interaction events
5. **Accessibility Testing**: Perform comprehensive accessibility audit

## Additional Notes

The Contact page effectively achieves the goals set in the project documentation:
- Provides multiple pathways for visitor inquiries
- Clearly separates contact (inquiry) from booking (action) flows
- Maintains the Celtic-inspired design system
- Incorporates the OM Method branding
- Optimizes for conversion with strategic CTAs

The implementation follows all the requested UK English standards with proper spelling and terminology (personalised, programmes, etc.) as specified in the project guidelines.
