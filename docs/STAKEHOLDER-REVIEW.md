Pages To Review

- Services → offerings, pricing clarity, conversion path
- Courses → structure and value, enrollment prompts
- Contact → guidance, form usability, response expectations
- Book Session → process clarity, confidence, and next steps

Devices
- Mobile (360–430px), Tablet (768–834px), Desktop (1280–1440px)

What To Look For
- Clarity: Is the message immediately clear? Are headings and paragraphs easy to read?
- Conversion: Are CTAs visible and compelling on each page?
- Visuals: Do images feel authentic and cohesive? Any that need replacement?
- Flow: Does navigation feel calm and intuitive?
- Brand: Colors/typography consistent and “peaceful, sophisticated, modern”?
- Accessibility: Contrast, focus states, alt text presence for key images.

Feedback Format (copy into email or a shared doc)
- Page/Section:
- Device (Mobile/Tablet/Desktop):
- Screenshot (link or embed):
- Issue (short description):
- Suggested change (if any):
- Priority (P0 critical / P1 important / P2 nice‑to‑have):

Submission
- Preferred: One consolidated document (Google Doc or email thread) using the format above.
- Alternative: Separate notes per page, but keep the same structure.

Timeline

- Next sprint: Prioritize P0/P1 items and ship updates the following week

Notes
