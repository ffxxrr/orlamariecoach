# Custom Analytics Implementation Plan
*Created: May 30, 2025*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation plan for OrlaMarieCoach's custom privacy-first analytics system. Based on the scope clarification, we recommend a **phased approach** that delivers core functionality quickly while building towards a comprehensive analytics platform.

## Recommended Approach: Progressive MVP (3-4 weeks core + 2-3 weeks enhanced)

### Phase 1: Core Analytics MVP (3-4 weeks)
Essential tracking and reporting to launch with basic analytics capabilities.

### Phase 2: Enhanced Analytics (2-3 weeks) 
Advanced features including real-time tracking, detailed reports, and business intelligence.

### Phase 3: Future Enhancements (Post-launch)
Machine learning insights, predictive analytics, and advanced visualization.

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Collection Layer
```typescript
// Client-side tracking script (privacy-first)
- Lightweight JavaScript tracker (~5KB gzipped)
- No cookies by default (localStorage for returning visitors)
- IP anonymization built-in
- Consent management integration
- Event batching for performance
```

#### 2. API Endpoints
```typescript
// Analytics API Routes
POST   /api/analytics/events     - Collect visitor events
POST   /api/analytics/pageview   - Track page views
POST   /api/analytics/session    - Session management
GET    /api/analytics/consent    - Check user consent
```

#### 3. Database Schema (Already Prepared)
```prisma
// Existing schema in place
- analytics_events table
- analytics_pageviews table  
- analytics_sessions table
- analytics_visitors table
- User consent tracking
```

#### 4. Admin Dashboard
```typescript
// Analytics Dashboard Pages
/admin/analytics                 - Overview dashboard
/admin/analytics/realtime       - Real-time visitors
/admin/analytics/pages          - Page performance
/admin/analytics/conversions    - Conversion tracking
/admin/analytics/reports        - Custom reports
```
