- Implement email notifications (contact form)
- Integrate Digital Samba widget

## Technology Decisions

- **Frontend Framework**: Astro 5.7 with Astrogon theme for public site
- **Admin UI**: Flowbite components for admin dashboard
- **CSS Framework**: Tailwind CSS (integrated with Flowbite)
- **Database**: MongoDB (running via Docker for local development) for storing coach data, bookings, and analytics
- **Authentication**: Simple authentication for admin area only
- **Booking System**: Digital Samba integration via widget
- **Email Service**: To be determined (options: SendGrid, Amazon SES)
- **Deployment Platform**: To be determined (options: Vercel, Netlify, DigitalOcean)

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Core Setup and Static Pages (Completed)
- [x] Create project documentation
- [x] Define technology stack
- [x] Create architecture diagram
- [x] Initialize repository (via template cloning)
- [x] Set up base Astro project with Flowbite (via template)
- [x] Create basic project structure (cleaned and organized template)
- [x] Implement essential static pages (Home, About, Contact placeholders)
- [x] Set up responsive navigation using Flowbite components (in MainLayout)
- [x] Implement initial styling and branding (Tailwind config, Flowbite JS)

- [ ] Finalize SEO optimization
- [ ] Complete documentation
- [ ] Set up deployment pipeline

## Development Decisions

Document important decisions and their rationales here as the project progresses:

1. **Framework Selection**: Chosen Astro for its content-focused approach and performance benefits. Astro's partial hydration model ("islands architecture") allows for minimal JavaScript while still supporting interactive components where needed.

2. **Component Library**: Selected Flowbite for its comprehensive UI components that work well with Astro and Tailwind CSS. The Flowbite Admin Dashboard template provides a significant head start on both public and admin interfaces.

3. **Content Strategy**: Will use Astro's Content Collections for blog posts and services to leverage built-in type safety and performance benefits.

4. **Booking Integration**: Digital Samba will be integrated via their widget rather than building a custom booking system, prioritizing reliability and feature completeness over custom design.

## Open Questions/Issues

List any current questions, issues, or decisions pending resolution:

- Hosting/deployment platform selection
- Email service provider selection
- Image optimization strategy
- Authentication implementation details for admin area
- MongoDB hosting option (Decided: Docker for local, containerized deployment likely)
- Investigate persistent `.env` loading issues in Astro SSR (Workaround implemented in `login.astro`).

5. **Environment Variable Loading Workaround**: Encountered persistent issues loading `.env` variables in SSR mode via standard Astro methods (`import.meta.env`, `Astro.locals`, `vite.envDir`, `.env.development`). Implemented a workaround in `app/src/pages/admin/login.astro` to explicitly load the `.env.development` file using `dotenv` within the POST request handler. This ensures variables are available for login logic but is non-standard and may warrant further investigation later. Variables were also prefixed with `PRIVATE_` as a best practice, though this alone didn't resolve the loading issue.
