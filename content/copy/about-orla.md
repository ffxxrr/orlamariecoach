# About Orla Marie - Personal Story & Credentials

## Personal Journey to Meditation

I started my journey of self-discovery at the age of 16. I felt a draw towards finding out my place in the universe and what was the 'bigger picture' - this led me towards reading the Bhagavad Gita, which in turn led me to join a local meditation class and then on to study TM. I continued on my meditation journey to this day.

What drew me specifically to this work was the unflinching knowing that there was more to life than what my five senses could tell me. That myself and others were wrapped up in dramas and situations that we would like to be free from and the realisation that peace is not something outside of us but something innately within us all.

## Irish Heritage & Influence

I am from Donegal Ireland, and I have a deep interest in Irish Mythology. My husband and I travel the country visiting ancient sites and standing stones, which I find deeply powerful, energetic sites - it's a passion we both share. I use a lot of grounding techniques drawing on the Irish countryside, woodland, and nature in my approach.
