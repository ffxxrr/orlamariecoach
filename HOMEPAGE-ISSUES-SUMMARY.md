# Homepage Issues - Resolved and Remaining

## Issues Fixed âœ…

1. **Build Error: 'use client' directive missing**
   - Fixed in `FreeMeditationSection.tsx` - Component was using `useState` without client directive
   - Fixed in `AudioPlayer.tsx` - Component was using hooks without client directive
   - Commit: 2cc51dc

2. **Missing Image File**
   - `meditation-sample.jpg` was referenced but didn't exist
   - Updated to use actual image: `/images/orla/optimized/about/7R500125.webp`
   - Created documentation for missing image

3. **Footer Logo Rendering Issue**
   - Changed from `fill` prop to fixed `width={32} height={32}` 
   - This prevents the image from stretching beyond its container

## Remaining Issue ðŸ”§

### CSS Not Loading Properly
The homepage is rendering but Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied:
- `min-h-screen` is not working (hero section only 234px tall instead of full viewport)
- Other Tailwind utility classes have no effect
- Custom CSS properties are loading correctly

**Symptoms:**
- Hero section is collapsed
- Layout is broken
- The meditation image is taking up the full viewport

**Potential Solutions:**
1. **Restart the dev server** - Sometimes Next.js needs a restart after fixing build errors
2. **Clear Next.js cache**: `rm -rf .next && npm run dev`
3. **Check if PostCSS is processing correctly**
4. **Verify Tailwind config is being picked up**

## Next Steps

1. Stop the current dev server (Ctrl+C)
2. Clear the Next.js build cache: `rm -rf .next`
3. Restart the dev server: `npm run dev`
4. If issue persists, check:
   - `tailwind.config.js` is properly configured
   - `postcss.config.js` exists and is configured
   - `globals.css` has the Tailwind directives
