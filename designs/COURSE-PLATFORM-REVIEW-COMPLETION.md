# Course Platform Mockup Review - CHAT 4 COMPLETION

**Session Date:** 2025-05-23  
**Task:** "Let's review the course platform mockup. Check for methodology naming issues and other feedback from the design review meeting."  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND ADDRESSED**

---

## üéØ **CRITICAL FINDING: METHODOLOGY NAMING ISSUE**

### **Problem Identified:**
The course platform mockup extensively used "OM Method" and "The OM Method" terminology throughout, which **directly conflicts** with client feedback from the 2025-05-22 Design Review Meeting:

> **Client Quote:** "Dislikes 'Orla Marie Method' terminology - needs alternative naming for signature approach"

### **Impact Assessment:**
- **HIGH IMPACT**: Affects core branding throughout course platform
- **Multiple Sections**: Hero, featured course, testimonials, FAQ sections
- **Development Blocker**: Cannot proceed with course platform implementation until resolved

### **Locations Fixed:**
1. Featured course title: "The OM Method: Complete Meditation Foundation" ‚Üí "[SIGNATURE_METHOD]: Complete Meditation Foundation"
2. Testimonials section: "through The OM Method" ‚Üí "through [client's personalized approach]"
3. FAQ section: "The beauty of The OM Method" ‚Üí "Orla's personalized approach"
4. Various other references updated to be methodology-neutral
