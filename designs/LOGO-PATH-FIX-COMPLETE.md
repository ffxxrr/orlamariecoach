# Logo Path Fix - Complete ✅

**Date**: May 23, 2025  
**Issue**: Missing Orla's logo on contact page and other current mockup files  
**Status**: RESOLVED  

## Problem Identified
All current mockup files in `designs/mockups/current/` had incorrect relative paths to the logo file:
- **Incorrect Path**: `../../public/images/brand/logo-square.png` (going only 2 levels up)
- **Correct Path**: `../../../public/images/brand/logo-square.png` (going 3 levels up)

## Root Cause
The mockup files are located in `designs/mockups/current/`, which is 3 directory levels below the project root where the `public/` directory is located. The previous path was only going up 2 levels instead of 3.

## Files Fixed
All current mockup files have been updated with the correct logo path:

1. ✅ **contact-current.html** - Navigation logo path fixed
2. ✅ **booking-current.html** - Navigation logo path fixed
3. ✅ **about-page-current.html** - Already had correct path
4. ✅ **services-current.html** - Navigation and footer logo paths fixed
5. ✅ **homepage-ultimate.html** - Navigation and footer logo paths fixed
6. ✅ **course-platform-current.html** - Navigation logo path fixed

## Verification
- Logo file exists at: `C:\Users\ffxxr\Documents\projects\orlamariecoach\public\images\brand\logo-square.png`
- All current mockup files now reference: `../../../public/images/brand/logo-square.png`
- Path correctly navigates: `current → mockups → designs → project root → public → images → brand → logo-square.png`

## Impact
- All current mockup pages now display Orla's logo correctly in navigation
- Footer logos (where present) also display correctly
- Professional brand consistency maintained across all mockup files
- No broken image references in current mockup demonstrations

## Next Steps
- Monitor any future mockup files to ensure correct relative paths
- Consider using absolute paths or build-time path resolution in final implementation
- Ensure production deployment uses appropriate asset serving strategy
